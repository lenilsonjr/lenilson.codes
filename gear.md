I try to live as a minimalist, keeping the number of things I constantly have around under **100**.

Most of this stuff was acquired in Brazil, where everything is considerable overpriced (with a few exceptions).

I don't like fancy brands for clothes and I try to keep a low profile.

This is all the stuff I currently have with me and how much I spent to acquire them.
