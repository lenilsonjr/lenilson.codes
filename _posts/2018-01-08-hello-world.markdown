Hello World! ðŸš€ðŸ¤“

Got me some time, but Anchor is finally running up correctly.

I'm not sure if it is the best pick for a CMS (*you know, shady CMS w/ low activity on GitHub*), but here I am.

I'll try to keep blogging in english (although I'm Brazillian), just because my thoughts seems to be more well organized in english.

I could keep using [Medium](https://medium.com/@lenilsonjr) but nah. Markdown is more fun.

Welcome and let me get back to work.
