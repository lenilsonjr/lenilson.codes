## 1 - Seo is more of an art than a discipline
One thing I noticed after diving a bit more deeper in the marketing world is that just as software development, SEO (marketing in general I guess) is full of "what ifs".

What if I change this keyword for this one? What if I create a specific indexed page for each of my plans instead of having a general one? What if I use this or that metatags? What if I completely change the copy of the page?

Of course, much of it is data driven. It needs to be. But in the beginning is more like empirical experimentation. You make changes and watch how that impact your traffic. You have a bunch of hypothesis and test them out.

I have to say that, being a developer for the last 6 or 7 years (yep, I started pretty early), and having focusing most of my career on how to output quality code, faster, I had a bit of misconception about digital marketing, specially SEO.

Before studying a bit, it looked much more like math than any other thing, like if there was tools and configurations that would automatically rank me number one on Google.

Now I see it is much more like writing code. You do something, it doesn't work, you don't know why, you tweak it bit, things change and you keep walking step by step.

Which led me to another point.

## 2 - Software developers can make good marketers
There's a name for markets who know how to dev: growth hackers, but I don't like that name very much.

I've come to believe that devs who know to market are unstoppable. If you can build and if you can sell, then everything else is secondary. And, of course, I'm trying to become that guy.

As I said before, it's all very new to me. I never bothered with marketing. Never watched a video about it. Never did a course about it. Only read about it in a superficial way.

I've been missing out on a lot of stuff because of this. I wish I spent less time on learning that New Hipster Framework™️ and more time learning how to get people to use the things I build.

Growth hackers are jut devs on steroids.
