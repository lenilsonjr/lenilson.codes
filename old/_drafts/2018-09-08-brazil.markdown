This is quite a sensitive topic (specially for 90% of my fellow Brazilians). People don't like to talk about it, and those who do are quickly labeled as anti-patriots or, as most people say, "vira-latas".

Brazil suffers from a strange kind of nationalism. Most people don't really care about the country, but still they don't like to see their country be criticised for its problems.

For decades, the norm here is to think short-term on everything. Why care about finding real solutions to hard problems when you can simply keep doing quick fixes and pretending everything's well?

I wonder when everything is going to falls down, and there will be no country left to criticise.

# When things have deeper roots
It's not uncommon to see politicians talking about how things are getting better, how violence is going down, how our economy is stronger. But what's really unsettling is to know most of it is bullshit.

The _modulus operandi_ of politicians and those who elect then are very very close:

- We want everything fixed (entitlement)
- We want it now (short-termism)
- We want don't wanna pay the price (we're entitled to it, aren't we?)

The results are of course catastrophic. Corruption everywhere. High taxes. Misuse of public money.

But what's really haunting is that there's no real opposition against it whatsoever.
