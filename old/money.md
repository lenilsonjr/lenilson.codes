title: So you're wondering if I'm a trustfund kid

Maybe you got to this page because you asked me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/money) "where does the money come from???". Maybe you're here from Google. Doesn't matter.

__No, my parents aren't rich. No, I'm not a trustfund baby. No, I didn't win the lottery. No, I'm not involved in "schemes". Yes, I hate MLM. No, I'm not racking up on credit card debt.__

There are two things to understand. And if you are really interested in the answer to the money question, here it goes:

- **It's not about how much you earn, it's about HOW you earn your money.**
- **It's also about how you decide to use the money you earn.**

Most people have normal office jobs, 8 hours a day, to pay their bills. Once a year they do average vacations to forget about their normal lifes. Don't feel attacked. That's 99% of people.

Why I'm not in this 99%? My income doesn't rely on a physical location, neither in a crazy number of hours I need to work.

**I work remotely, and decide my own schedule.**

This gives me the freedom to work 60 hours this week and do nothing at all next week, or do only 15 in both and accomplish less, etc. This also gives me the freedom of opening my laptop in any random coffee shop around the world and do what I need to do, without the need to commute to an office or clog my time with bullshit.

If you're wondering, **my primary occupation is software engineer**, but there's dozens of other careers that are remote friendly. There are so many that I'm not even going to bother listing them here. Stop scrolling Instagram and google it.

Now, to the second point.

99% of the people choose to spend their money on expensive cars, apartments, weddings, clothes, rings, whatever.

I chose to spend my money staying in nice places every once in a while and buying flight tickets to the places I want to see. Ah, and of course eating nice food 3 times a day.

Yes, what you see on Instagram is my real life. But the opportunity cost here is that I chose this life over paying a university tuition, financing a home, buying a car, etc.

I don't consider myself rich. **My networth is laughable at best and my income is average to low if you compare it against high developed places.**

**The difference is exactly those two things: 1) I don't need to be present in a spefic place and in a spefic time to work 2) I choose to buy experiences over things.**

Capiche?
